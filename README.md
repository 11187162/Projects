# WSN-MAC-Protocols

*** **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** ***


This repository will contain the source codes of XX-MAC, EX-MAC, and QX-MAC protocols. All the proposed schemes were implemented and tested in OMNeT++ 5.5.1 using INET 4.2.5 installed in Ubuntu 18.04. You can email me to get the codes.


**What you need**

In order to run this project, you will need the following:

- OMNeT++ [https://omnetpp.org/download/old.html]
- INET [https://inet.omnetpp.org/2021-05-18-INET-4.3.2-released.html]

**How to run**

This section will provide step-by-step instructions on how to conduct simulation experiments using the proposed scheme at the MAC layer.
